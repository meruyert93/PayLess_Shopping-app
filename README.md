## My app is called "PayLess"

In Germany, supermarkets offer special discounts on products each week. 
Therefore, my initial idea was to combine the discounts of different supermarkets on one platform "PayLess".
At this stage, the focus of the app was narrowed down to Edeka supermarket, since, unfortunately, other supermarkets do not offer public APIs for usage.
On the first page one can see all discounts from Edeka, which update automatically for each week.
The second page offers the opportunity to find Edeka stores via Google Maps, where you can enter your address and find the closest Edeka nearby.
With my APP, you will make only smart decisions and save your money. Have fun :)
